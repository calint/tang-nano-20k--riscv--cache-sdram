# About SDRAM Controller HS

There are no special requirements, the default parameters settings should be fine.

However, it is recommended that the customer check the parameters against the [SDRAM Memory] data sheet, or fine-tune it according to the actual speed value to be run.

Note the EtronTech EM638325GD 2M x 32 bit Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) datasheet can be requested from EtronTech if you need it.
