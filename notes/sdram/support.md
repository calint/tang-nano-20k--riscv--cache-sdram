# Support from Gowin regarding IP "SDRAM Controller HS"

There are no special requirements, the default parameters settings should be fine.

However, it is recommended that the customer check the parameters against the [SDRAM Memory] data sheet, or fine-tune it according to the actual speed value to be run.

Note the EtronTech EM638325GD 2M x 32 bit Synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) datasheet can be requested from EtronTech if you need it.

If the customer wants to achieve higher speed performance, such as 150MHz clock speed, you can use the following parameters to set the SDRAM Controller IP.
